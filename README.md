Monty Project
This project involves creating an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files, which are scripts written in the Monty scripting language. The interpreter operates on a unique stack with specific instructions to manipulate it.

 monty

0x19. C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO

Data structures provided Monty Language(byteCode files)

 0_ push, pall - Implement the push and pall opcodes.

 1_ pint - Implement the pint opcode

 2_ pop - implement the pop opcode

 3_ swap - Implement the swap opcode

 4_ add - Implement the add opcode.

 5_ nop - Implement the nop opcode.

Learning Objectives
By completing this project, we gained knowledge and understanding of the following concepts:

General
LIFO and FIFO: The meaning of Last In, First Out (LIFO) and First In, First Out (FIFO) principles.
Stacks and Queues: What a stack and a queue are and when to use each data structure.
Implementations: Common implementations of stacks and queues.
Use Cases: The most common use cases of stacks and queues.
Global Variables: The proper way to use global variables.
Programming Skills
C Programming: Implementing functionalities in the C programming language.
Header Files: Organizing the code with header files, including prototypes for functions.
Coding Style: Following the Betty style guidelines for clean and readable code.
Memory Management: Utilizing malloc and free for dynamic memory allocation.
GitHub Usage: Managing the code in a GitHub repository, ensuring compliance with project rules.
